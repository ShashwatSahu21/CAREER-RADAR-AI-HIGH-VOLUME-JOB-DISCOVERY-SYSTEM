## ⚡ Key System Components

### 1. Robust Collectors Layer (`src/collectors/`)
To bypass aggressive anti-bot protections (like Cloudflare and Akamai) without paying for premium proxy rotating services, the system targets structured APIs and public guest search endpoints:
- **Greenhouse, Lever, and Ashby**: Query official public JSON endpoints directly.
- **Workday**: Makes `POST` requests to public search directories for specific firms (e.g., Boston Dynamics).
- **Tesla**: Intercepts the internal endpoint used by Tesla's browser site (`/cua-api/apps/careers/state`).
- **LinkedIn**: Targets the public guest search API (`seeMoreJobPostings`) using a composite `OR` keyword query. This reduces total requests from dozens down to 1-2 per location, avoiding rate limits.
- **Naukri**: Formulates requests with desktop headers (`appid: 109`, `systemid: Naukri`) and fails gracefully if token validation rejects them.
- **Internshala**: Parses standard search lists with BeautifulSoup.

### 2. Job Normalization & Exclusions (`src/engine.py`)
All crawled postings are transformed into a standardized `Job` dataclass.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Excludes jobs with matching IDs or apply URLs present in `data/seen_jobs.json`.
- **Negative Filters**: Discards jobs whose titles contain telecalling, generic sales, STEM trainers, teachers, or customer service terms.
- **Experience Filtering**: Restricts results to entry-level/intern postings. It rejects titles containing senior indicators (Senior, Lead, Manager, Principal, Sr, etc.) and parses descriptions to filter out roles requiring 3+ years of experience.

### 3. Keyword Scoring & Geographic Filtering Engine (`src/engine.py`)
- **Geographic Constraints**: Reject onsite hybrid/physical jobs outside of Bangalore (e.g., Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai, USA) while accepting Bangalore onsite, Hybrid Bangalore, Remote India, and global remote jobs.
- **Scoring System**: Matches lowercase words in titles (and falls back to descriptions) against weighted keywords to calculate a score:
  - **100**: Product Intern, APM, Technical Product, Founder's Office, Startup Generalist
  - **95**: Program Management, Robotics, Physical AI, Embodied AI, Mechatronics, Autonomous Systems
  - **90**: ROS2, Computer Vision, Software Engineering, Python (85), SDE, Backend
  - **80**: AI, Machine Learning, Data Engineer
  - **70**: Technical Consulting, Solutions Engineer, Pre-Sales
- **Score < 50**: Discarded.
- **Tiers**: Categorizes matches into **Tier A** (Score > 80), **Tier B** (65-80), and **Tier C** (50-65).

### 4. Resilient Error Handling & Retry Logic (`src/collectors/base.py`)
- Extends all requests with custom retry wrappers.
- Implements exponential backoff (e.g., waiting 1.5s, 2.25s, etc.) when hit with rate limits (429) or gateway timeouts (504).
- Isolates collector execution: if a specific website is down or blocking, it prints a stack trace to log outputs, ignores the collector, and continues processing data from all other active platforms.
- Database cleanups run on every execution to prune seen items older than 60 days, keeping repository file sizes minimal.
